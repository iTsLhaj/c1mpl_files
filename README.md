#### R/W FILES

- still learing so this lil project will be a simple implementation of FILES in c
- in this case i will try to simulate how to save and read game data / player data


#### ISSUES!

- get_last_save_file doesen't literally the last saved file need's to be fixed by sorting all the .u1p files ** please remove the savedir **
- game loop in the main func will be infinite if a string is insertend instead of int ** matlefsh o tktb clear or smth instead of a digit! **

#### INSTALLATION:

```sh
./build.sh <a custom game name>
```

.eg

```sh
./build.sh broken_game_idc
```

#### USAGE:

*i'll upload a video later ^^*

0 used to exit
1 for changing player values to a new specific ones
